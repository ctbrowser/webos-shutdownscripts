# How long should watchdog's timer be?  It takes 8 seconds from when I
# emit control-alt-delete until the logs stop.  10 or 15 would suffice
# in that case, and I doubt the user will still have the battery in
# place if it stays hung for 60 seconds.
#
# Should probably be a parameter.  Will have to be a parameter if
# called from rcU.d before the updater runs.
